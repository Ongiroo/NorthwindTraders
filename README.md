# NorthwindTraders

Northwind project used Entity Framework Core. Jason started by creating the database from scripts, scaffolding the model within a project, adding a migration for the initial create, and finally, adding a migration to seed the data from scripts. He claims that a code first version of Northwind that you can run anywhere – Windows, Linux, or Mac.

Note: it uses refactoring the generated code including cleaning up the data context, renaming the entities, and renaming the navigation properties. We then built two migrations, the first responsible for creating the database and the second for seeding the database
